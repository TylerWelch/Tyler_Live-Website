# Tyler_Live-Website

Hey Welcome this is code I used to build my personal website. I used the Python Django Framework to create it. Its still a rough a draft 
as I have alot of details and articles to add to to it. This was problably my 5th attempt at building a website using python, I orginally 
started out learning flask but slowlly drifted over over to Django and is now my favorite focus in building site backends, do to its model 
approcah and its unlimited possiblitlies, escpacilly in scaling. I used the bootstrap4 framework for first time in this site after 
priparilly just using Materialize in my design. The nice thing about bootstrap is it has simplistic feel (Not that vague cluttered 
woodpress look) and great mobile conversion with its grid system. I then deployed the set up off a Linode server using a 
UncomplicatedFirewall and Apache2. But I'm changing this as I'm experimenting with different setups currently.
