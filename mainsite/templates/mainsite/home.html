<h1>Welcome to TylerWelch.Live</h1>
  <h4>This is my Personal Professional Website.</h4>
    <body class="text-faded text-center"> As you can see its currently missing some flavor but fear not I will get to that good old HTML/CSS soon! Check out my about page for more info on me though! But, welcome to my little piece of the internet and a proof of point in demonstration of development and deployment. In the back end I developed my website with the Python Language through the Django framework, and then deployed my application using a Linode Server using a Linux Ubuntu operating system with the Apache2  deployment server. For design Iâ€™m using the Bootstrap4 Framework, though there are many to choose from I just like the overall simple feel Bootstrap has to offer. I Plan to go more into detail by writing some articles in my blog section on the building of my current application, as well as other projects that I am working on in effort to help build upon on my never ending development education and to add to research in attempt to aide in any solution to a problem that I can help. I mean that is what Engineers jobs are, right?! To find solutions to problems, and then share in case it can help to be applied somewhere else.</body>
