	<h3>What I'm doing</h3>
	<body>I'm Tyler and I currently on the path to becoming a developer. I'd like to go more specifically in what applications but I currently have a pretty open outlook as our tech development fields are ever so vast and cross application are seeming to be endless, as well as my Interests application development, deployment and the networks they use. This can be attributed to my inner need to figure all things out, and I satisfy this with learning and problem solving. I've realized that after working certain jobs that I would quickly lose interest when the need for professional opinion was no longer required, and by combining that with my natural gift for technical know and computation science I know it was clear I was a developer. Well not really, the gears did not start turning and passion start flowing until I got through my first coding tutorial and It was off from there. My current level of ability to code as well field knowledge Is in the intermediate realm where I have comprehensive overview understanding of Frontend, Backend, scripting and the networks that employ them. My main programming language is currently Python, I make an effort to code in python for a good amount of time every day to improve my natural writing ability and applying in real application. I also know HTML/CSS, SQL, and JavaScript. After, Here soon after I've advanced some more in Python, I plan to dive a bit deeper into some PHP and C# especially .Net structure due to that so many companies backbends are built upon these frameworks. I spend the other good majority of my time learning the Unix systems and structure, right now Iâ€™m mostly using Linux operating systems for scripting, server connections and deployments. But, I have a never ending list of things I still need and what to learn. Recently, I've recognized that my skill level is at a point that would allow me to be effective in the employment of a company, so I am currently in a search of employment opportunities with companies in need of individuals with entry level developer skill sets. If you have any propositions or ideas please feel free to contact me at my email below.</body>
